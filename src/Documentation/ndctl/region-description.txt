DESCRIPTION
-----------
A generic REGION device is registered for each PMEM range or
BLK-aperture set.  LIBNVDIMM provides a built-in driver for these REGION
devices.  This driver is responsible for reconciling the aliased DPA
mappings across all regions, parsing the LABEL, if present, and then
emitting NAMESPACE devices with the resolved/exclusive DPA-boundaries
for the nd_pmem or nd_blk device driver to consume.
