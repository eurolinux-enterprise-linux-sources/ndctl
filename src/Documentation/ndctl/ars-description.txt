DESCRIPTION
-----------
NVDIMM Address Range Scrub is a capability provided by platform firmware
that allows for the discovery of memory errors by system software. It
enables system software to pre-emptively avoid accesses that could lead
to uncorrectable memory error handling events, and it otherwise allows
memory errors to be enumerated.
