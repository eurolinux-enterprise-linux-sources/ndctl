ndctl-setup-passphrase(1)
=========================

NAME
----
ndctl-setup-passphrase - setup and enable the security passphrase for an NVDIMM

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'ndctl setup-passphrase' <nmem0> [<nmem1>..<nmemN>] -k <key_handle> [<options>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Setup and enable a security passphrase for one or more NVDIMMs.

For this command to succeed, it is expected that the master key has previously
been loaded into the user keyring. More information on how this can be done
can be found in the kernel documentation at:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/security/keys/trusted-encrypted.html

The passphrase blobs are created in the {ndctl_keysdir} directory with a file
name format of `"nvdimm_<dimm-unique-id>_<hostname>.blob"`

The command will fail if the passphrase is already in the user keyring or if
a passphrase blob already exists in {ndctl_keysdir}.

OPTIONS
-------
<dimm>::
include::xable-dimm-options.txt[]

-k::
--key_handle=::
	Handle for the master 'kek' (key-encryption-key) that will be used for
	sealing the passphrase(s) for the given DIMM(s). The format is:
	`<key type>:<key description>`
	  e.g. `trusted:nvdimm-master` +
	NOTE: The 'kek' is expected to have been loaded into the user keyring.

-m::
--master-passphrase::
	Indicates that we are managing the master passphrase instead of the
	user passphrase.

-v::
--verbose::
        Emit debug messages.
